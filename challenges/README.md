## Package layout

Each example is three self-contained layers. Import the file that matches the step. A folder that contains all three imports as `variation.json` unless you ask for another layer.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `requirements.json` | Job description text and optional author prompt. Enough for the builder. |
| `challenge.json` | Metadata, `compute_provider`, skills, tool names, video rubric, and how to generate a session. |
| `variation.json` | One locked instance: concrete problem statement, rubric, compute, and `assets` paths. This replaces `skillflare.json`. |
| `truth_pack.md` | Grader mark scheme. Travels with `variation.json`. |
| `workspace/` | Starter files named by `variation.json` `assets`. |

`compute_provider` is required on `challenge.json` and `variation.json` and must be one of:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `local` | Browser desktop (`screen/`); no cloud machine |
| `container` | Fly.io Machine webtop |
| `vm` | Google Cloud VM webtop |

[`weather-basics`](weather-basics/) is `local`. The other complete examples are `container`.

See each package’s README for details.
